                I'm not a professional designer, but I truly enjoy doodling and working on some design projects. I once
                initiated a mutual learning program with the designer at my company, who is also a good friend of mine
                - j. During that time, she taught me typography skills and basic aesthetics, while I taught her
                HTML/CSS/JS.

                Here are some records of my journey so far.
                I'm still dedicated to continuously creating my own projects because it genuinely brings me joy.
