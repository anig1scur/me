                        Although I hadn't fully recovered from Covid that I caught two weeks prior, I enthusiastically accepted my colleagues' invitation to hike in Yubeng.

                        Thanks to my colleagues' planning, I didn't need to do any preparation or research about this place. However, it turned out to be an incredible first multi-day trekking experience for me.

                        My favorite part of the trip was hiking the Chongcao route. Under clear skies, I was deeply moved by the surrounding snow-capped mountains. Even now, I can still recall the crisp, cold air at the mountain peak.
