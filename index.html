                                I'm passionate about crafting designs that combine beauty and function, creating
                                meaningful experiences for users. Beyond work, I'm interested in music making, 3D

                        The project emerged in response to the endless PCR testing demands in Beijing at that time. Although it can't be open-sourced for various reasons, I really love the idea behind it. My colleagues in backend, frontend, and design completed it together while we were in lockdown.

                        For this project, I used Colyseus to manage the room-related logic, which made handling multiplayer sessions much easier. I handled the design myself, though I'm not fully satisfied with some of the details yet. Wish I could continue refining it until it's exactly how I want it.

                Thanks to my buddies' planning, I didn't need to do any preparation or research about this place. However, it turned out to be an incredible first multi-day trekking experience for me.

                My favorite part of the trip was hiking the Chongcao route. Under clear skies, I was deeply moved by the surrounding snow-capped mountains. Even now, I can still recall the crisp, cold air at the mountain peak.`,

Despite various unexpected situations - police checkpoints, a hiker's accident - and altitude sickness that left me weak and without appetite, I still managed to camp alone along the way, setting up my tent, fetching water, and cooking meals. In the end, I completed most of the circuit route.

This journey taught me that human willpower can be remarkably strong, and once you overcome the initial hardships, things start to get better - like finding light at the end of the tunnel.

I had what might have been the best black pork of my life there, and if I have the chance, I would love to return to Western Sichuan for another taste :P

Although Rinjani's altitude isn't particularly high, the Day 2 summit push was incredibly challenging for me. Nevertheless, I persevered and managed to catch the tail end of the sunrise! I consider this a truly meaningful experience. If I have the chance, I'd love to return to Lombok for a motorcycle tour around the island.`,
