                        The project emerged in response to the endless PCR testing demands in Beijing at that time. Although it can't be open-sourced for various reasons, I really love the idea behind it. My colleagues in backend, frontend, and design completed it together while we were in lockdown.

                        The repository is humorously titled "Have you done nuclear acid today?" originally reflecting a playful take on the term "核酸"

                        For this project, I used Colyseus to manage the room-related logic, which made handling multiplayer sessions much easier. I handled the design myself, though I'm not fully satisfied with some of the details yet. Wish I could continue refining it until it's exactly how I want it.

                        This tool helps users preview the theme directly, without the need for constant restarts, and also allows them to export the theme in a format supported by fcitx5. 

                        It's been a useful project that streamlines the customization process and makes it much easier to experiment with themes.

Despite various unexpected situations - police checkpoints, a hiker's accident - and altitude sickness that left me weak and without appetite, I still managed to camp alone along the way, setting up my tent, fetching water, and cooking meals. In the end, I completed most of the circuit route.

This journey taught me that human willpower can be remarkably strong, and once you overcome the initial hardships, things start to get better - like finding light at the end of the tunnel.

I had what might have been the best black pork of my life there, and if I have the chance, I would love to return to Western Sichuan for another taste :P
